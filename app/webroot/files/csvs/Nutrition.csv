9. After 6-8 hours, remove from bowl and put into sterile containers and refrigerate for several hours until well set.
10. Add berries etc as preferred.
11. To make Greek yogurt, after removing from the oven, place a strainer inside a large bowl. Line the strainer with cheesecloth or coffee filters. Pour the yogurt in, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. A couple times during the day, pour off the drained liquid. Once the yogurt has drained and achieved the thick consistency you desire, you can divvy it up into smaller containers or one larger one. Make sure it's covered tightly.

1/2 cup self-raising flour
3 tsps of melted butter (unsalted)

Filling:
1/2 cup of red bean paste (you can buy this ready-made from most Asian grocery stores)","1. In a small bowl, mix the yeast with 2 tbsps warm water, 1 tsp sugar and 1 tsp of bao flour.  Mix well to get rid of the lumps, cover with a damp kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place until frothy, this should take about 15 minutes.  If the mixture is not frothy at all, it is likely that the yeast has died so redo this step with some new yeast.  Meanwhile, cut up 12 squares of baking paper (measuring roughly 3 inches by 3 inches) for placing the buns on while steaming.
2. In a large bowl, sift the remaining all-purpose flour and self-raising flour.  Add in the rest of the sugar, the yeast mixture, the warm water and melted butter.  Use a wooden spoon to form a soft dough.  
3. Prepare a floured working surface.  Turn out the soft dough and start kneading with your hands until smooth and elastic, this should take at least 10 minutes.  The dough should not be too sticky.  Dust with extra bao flour as needed.
4. Prepare an oiled bowl and place the dough into it.  Cover with a damp kitchen towel and allow to proof for at least 1 hour or until doubled.  Note that it will take longer usually to proof in colder and drier climate.
5. Punch down dough to remove some of the air.  Prepare a floured working surface.  Knead the dough briefly for about 5 minutes.  Roll the dough into a log.  I do this for easier division of the dough for each bun.  Meanwhile, you can prepare a wok for steaming, by the time you finish sealing the buns, the water should be boiling rapidly and you can immediately steam the buns.
6. Divide the dough into 12 portions roughly.  Take one portion of dough, knead with your hands lightly and form into a ball.  Flatten the ball with your hands and press down with your thumb in a circular motion.  
7. Spoon about 1 1/2 tsps of red bean paste into the middle of the flattened dough.  Seal the dough by gathering the edges together and gently twist to seal.  Place the bun, seal-side down onto the prepared baking paper squares.
8. Steam the buns over high heat (covered) for about 15 minutes. Note that the buns will expand while steaming for the first time.  Do watch the wok to make sure that there is enough water while steaming.
9. Serve hot.  If there are still leftover buns after the first serving, allow to cool and store in an air-tight container, they can be re-steamed later.",Steamed red-bean bun_1_portrait.png,Steamed red-bean bun_1_medium.png,80 MINS,160 KCAL

Yong Tau Foo,Yong Tau Foo,4,"1 tub fish paste (or optionally a homemade batch)
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
2 tsp soy sauce
1/2 C chicken broth or water
1/2 tsp sesame oil
1 1/2 tsp cornstarch, _dissolved in 2 T water
+ your choice  _vegetables for stuffing (in this case, we used bitter melon, Japanese _eggplant, okra, and peppers)
+ oil for frying
","1. You can stuff any kind of vegetables you want. Hearty stuff works best. Slice bitter melon into 3/4_ rings, and poke the seeds and fuzz out with a spoon or butter knife. Cut eggplant on a bias into 1_-thick pieces. Make an incision most of the way�but not all the way�through each eggplant piece crosswise. (Think of a _chattering-teeth toy. You�re going to be stuffing fish paste between the top and bottom rows of �teeth.�) For okra, make a slit in the middle of each pod, beginning just below the okra�s cap and stopping 1/4_ short of the bottom point. Do the same with chili peppers, but remove their seeds.
2. Force fish paste into the cavities of each receptacle vegetable. This takes some practice, but if nine-year-old me could do it, so can you.
3. Heat 1/4_ of vegetable oil in a pan over high heat. Add the stuffed vegetables to the pan�careful not to crowd them�and brown them on all sides. Remove to a paper-towel-lined platter.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a clean pan over medium heat. Cook the garlic until fragrant. Add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, chicken broth, and sesame oil. Then add the cornstarch slurry last. Stir and cook until thickened.
5. Steam the vegetables in the sauce until completely cooked, about 6 minutes. Make sure each piece gets coated with sauce. Eat with white rice.
6. After 6-8 hours, remove from bowl and put into sterile containers and refrigerate for several hours until well set.
7. To make Greek yogurt, after removing from the oven, place a strainer inside a large bowl. Line the strainer with cheesecloth or coffee filters. Pour the yogurt in, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate. A couple times during the day, pour off the drained liquid. Once the yogurt has drained and achieved the thick consistency you desire, you can divvy it up into smaller containers or one larger one. Make sure it's covered tightly.
8. Imperative that all your utensils and containers are clean. When in doubt, run it all through the dishwasher before using.
