Healthy Brown Rice Chicken Rice,"Generally speaking, eating right is about choosing simple,
unrefined things.  Foods in their most natural state do not contain added sugar�that�s
why it�s called �added sugar�! Added sugar is sucrose, the type
that you add to your tea and coffee. It is completely void of any
benefit to your body and doesn�t give your body the nutrients
it craves. It also spikes your blood sugar levels giving you
that �sugar high� followed by a sudden dip. This dip creates a
desire for foods that are high in added sugar again - crvings! So avoid added sugars and eat simple, unrefined whole foods. "
Char Kway Teow,"Avoid highly processed food. They may be convenient but highly processed foods are usually high in chemical additives, trans fats, salts and refined sugars. For example, think about a fast-food burger. Every item on it, from the bun to the sauce, was processed in a factory and created in a laboratory. It�s packed with enough artificial colors and preservatives to make it look as pretty as a picture and last as long as possible. So avoid highly processed food and your body will thank you!"
Mee Siam,"Salads shouldn�t be fatty. This is a vegetable course so keep it tasty, but make sure it is healthy. That means avoiding anything in a creamy sauce (coleslaw, caesar, pasta salads, and potato salads) and making sure you minimise the sauce/dressing you add."
Prawn Noodle (Vermicelli) Soup,"The more water you drink, the higher your metabolic rate will be. So drink up!"
Har Mee (Prawn Noodles),"It's not just what you eat, it's also how much you eat that matters. The appropriate serving size of carbs (brown rice, potatoes) should be about the size of your fist."
Chinese Chicken Fried Rice,"Another golden rule of clean eating is to include as much fresh
produce in your daily diet as possible. Fresh vegetables and fresh
fruit provide the vitamins and nutrients to keep you feeling as
good as you look, and the soluble fibre to make sure you suck
every last bit of nutrition out of everything else you eat. They are
the foundation stones to make your dietary system better and
healthier.
Many people think they can get these vitamins and supplements
from a simple greens supplement. These aren�t bad, but the real
thing is always the best option. We believe if it came from a plant
you should eat it like the body was designed to do. But if it was
made by a plant then you should try and avoid it. And if you�re
honest you�re often just using this expensive supplement as an
excuse to cheat when you get hungry later on.
So get familiar with the best-tasting in-season fruits and
vegetables and become a master of seasons and spices. Read
recipes like they�re great literature. Plan a date with yourself and
visit your local farmers market every week to buy local, fresh,
delicious, colourful, healthy and natural produce."
Soy-Seared Cod Fish with Chinese Greens & Ginger Rice,"Drink more water. Observe a plant before and after watering and relate these
benefits to your body and brain. The amount of water in the

should drink lots of water. Pure, unadulterated water. Not soda.
Not fruit juice. Not coffee ... water ... and lots of it.

This includes artificial sweeteners! The fewer ingredients the better as the food is probably more natural and less processed."

(The best is unpolished/less processed rice, because it is rich in B vitamins.) Rice is eaten to supplement the meal in Asia, not a main course. Rice has always been a popular carbohydrate, cheap to grow and easy to transport and store. But as a carbohydrate it is converted into sugar during the digestive process. This means it can cause a dramatic effect in our glycemic index. This is good for fast energy, but bad if you want to avoid blood sugar fluctuations and bad for those who are diabetic or pre-diabetic. Rice combinations are less starchy therefore less sugar conversion and lower in calories."

on your plate. "
